# Temporal Fusion Transformer
## What is a Transformer?
__A Transformer is a deep neural network that learns the relationship between input sequences to generate output sequences__

The most important concept of the Transformer is the “Attention mechanism”. The Attention mechanism identifies which portions of the input sequences are more important than other input sequences. It hence should be paid the most attention by using the magnitude of attention weights.

__Attention mechanism is inspired by human attention as we pay attention to what’s most important to us__

## Temporal Fusion Transformers(TFT)
Temporal Fusion Transformer (TFT) is an attention-based deep neural network architecture enabling multi-horizon forecasting to achieve high performance while enabling new forms of interpretability, making it trustworthy.

### Temporal Fusion Transformer (TFT) enables multi-horizon time series forecasting, which predicts a variable of interest at multiple future time steps.
To enable multi-horizon forecasting, 

### TFT supports 
__1. heterogeneous data sources such as known future information like holidays__

__2. static metadata like store size, store location, etc, as well as__

__3. historical exogenous time series data like historical sales__

TFT is also an interpretable transformer-based model for time series forecasting, making it trustworthy.
